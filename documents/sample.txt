Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data. It has three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. Common applications include image classification, spam detection, and recommendation systems.

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labels. It's used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

Reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions.
